[Week 8 Project: Testing](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/pre-apprenticeship/testing/project/)

[see tutorial here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp)

[view page here](https://fac25.github.io/testing-project-Suraj-Lisa/)

- [ ] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

test("Submitting a new task adds it to the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});

- [ ] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

test("Checking an entry marks it as complete", () => {
  // test goes here
});

- [ ] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

test("Deleting an entry removes it from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});

- [ ] Use all the features of the app without a mouse

Stretch goal:
- [ ] Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

test("Toggling the filter hides completed tasks from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});

Acceptance Criteria
- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
